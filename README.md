## General info
It is one of the Data Analysing projects which is suppoused to hone my skills in that category.

Main goals of the project were:
* Combine a Notebook with HTML Markup.
* Apply Python List slicing techniques to Pandas DataFrame.
* Aggregate data using the .agg() function.
* Create scatter plots, bar charts and line charts with two axes in Matplotlib.
* Merge DataFrames that share a common key.

As a notebook I used Datalore from Jetbrains.

Data used in this project were generated from Stack Overflow.

It's one of the projects from [Angela's Python Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)
